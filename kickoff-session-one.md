# Kickoff Session One -  Strategic Design/Time Management

## What is Strategic Design

- Keep It Simple Silly (Keep it Stupidly Simple)
- Robot Mechanism Importance
- Don't be afrain to show your priorities on your robot

> Use the kit of parts for the drivetrain. Don't overthink / over design the drivetrain.

- Drivetrain should be done by the end of week two.
  - This lets the drivers practice driving from the get-go

> Story Time: Make sure your materials can handle the difference in environment. The instructor stated that they used PVC in Florida and when they go to the dryer environment of Georgia, it all cracked.

## Time Management

- Everything is done in a timely fashion
- Set reachable goals
- Keep yourself to goals
- Come together as a team to work on the things that are behind

> Use a Gantt Chart with time based goals

*Personal notes: Meh.. Like to see something that is less waterfall*

There are 8 weeks until competition. At 7 weeks needs to be 80% complete.

### Competition Practices

- Lable all of the wiring (documentation)
- Practice swapping out parts so that during a competition
