# Orlando FRC Regional at UCF - 2022

This event took place March 10th - 12th - 2022 at UCF Addition Arena

## What we did well:

- Jose's Driving / Consistency
- Autonomous Mode worked great
- Coding at comp - despite being stressed
- We did a good job of scouting, although the information didn't always get to the pits
- We came together as a team to overcome adversity.
- Helped other teams in the spirit of Coopetition

## What we learned:

- It was top heavy
- It was too big and shouldn't exist outside the frame
- Firmware needs to be updated regularly and get the latest a week before the event

## What should we do differently next time:

- Engineer better bumpers that we can quickly swap between rounds
- Build a Control Box to carry to the arena instead of dragging the laptop and controllers dangling.
- Utilize all of our resources better
- Be prepared a week before competition so as not to spend the weekend before finishing engineering activities
- Use CAD software to design parts for printing / manufacturing
- Develop a Scouting System where when putting in notes from the stands, they are published and displayed back in the pits.
  
## What still puzzles us:

- How to use CAD Software
- How the Business Plan works (we had to present this)
- What is the best drivetrain to use?

## Actions this year:

- [x] Clean Up the Lab / Class
- [ ] Build new bumpers

> We can take these learnings into more specific Retros or Blameless Post Mortems
