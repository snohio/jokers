# Orlando FRC Regional at UCF - 2022

This event took place March 10th - 12th - 2022 at UCF Addition Arena

## What we did well:

  - Released first version on time. 

## What we learned:

  - Must give hosting company 2 days more notice before deployment
  - Clearcase sucks

## What should we do differently next time:

  - Automate all deployment procedures. We need repeatability so we can deploy more reliably, more often.

## What still puzzles us:

  - Why are we still using such a horrible VCS? It's 2010.

## Actions:

- [ ] Action One
- [ ] Action Two

> We can take these learnings into more specific Retros or Blameless Post Mortems
