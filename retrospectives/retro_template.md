What we did well:
  - Released first version on time. 

What we learnt:
  - Must give hosting company 2 days more notice before deployment
  - Clearcase sucks

What should we do differently next time:
  - Automate all deployment procedures. We need repeatability so we can deploy more reliably, more often.

What still puzzles us:
  - Why are we still using such a horrible VCS? It's 2010.
